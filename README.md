# Stack Overflow Users

A small iOS app that shows the top 20 Stack Overflow users by reputation and lets you follow or unfollow them locally.

## Requirements

- Xcode 15 or newer
- **Deployment target: iOS 16.0** (uses `OSAllocatedUnfairLock`, `UIButton.Configuration`, `UIImage.preparingForDisplay()`, and diffable `reconfigureItems(_:)`, all of which require iOS 15+; I picked iOS 16 to keep modern concurrency APIs available without caveats).
- Swift 5.9+ — plain `async throws`, no typed `throws(_:)`.
- No third-party dependencies.

## Running

```bash
open StackOverflowUsers.xcodeproj
```

Pick an iOS 16+ iPhone simulator and hit run. The `StackOverflowUsers` scheme is checked into `xcshareddata` so it shows up automatically after a fresh clone. If you'd rather (re)generate the project from scratch, install [xcodegen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) and run `xcodegen generate` — `project.yml` is the source of truth for the project file.

The target is iPhone-only in portrait. I scoped it deliberately rather than shipping an untested Universal layout — the rest of the checklist matters more at this scope.

## What it does

- Fetches the top 20 users from `https://api.stackexchange.com/2.2/users?order=desc&sort=reputation&site=stackoverflow` on launch.
- Renders each user with a circular avatar, display name, and locale-formatted reputation.
- A tap on the follow button (or a leading swipe) toggles follow state. Followed rows show both a blue checkmark indicator and a tinted "Unfollow" button — the spec asks for an indicator *and* an unfollow option, so both are present at once.
- A table-header segmented control toggles between **All** and **Followed**. When the filter yields nothing, a dedicated "No followed users yet" empty state is rendered (no retry button — it's not an error).
- Follow state is keyed by `user_id` and persists across launches.
- On failure — offline, non-2xx, API error body, decoding — the app keeps any previously loaded rows and surfaces a retry alert. With no stale data, it falls back to a full-screen empty state with a "Try Again" button. Pull-to-refresh is also wired up.

## Architecture

MVVM with a lightweight coordinator.

```
App/                Scene + coordinator bootstrap
Domain/             User, StackExchangeResponse, AppError — pure value types
Data/
  Network/          UserService: URLSession + decoder, maps errors into AppError
  Persistence/      UserDefaultsFollowRepository: Set<Int> behind an unfair lock
  ImageLoading/     ImageLoader actor: NSCache + in-flight dedup
Presentation/
  UserList/         View model, view controller, cell, cell model
  Shared/           EmptyStateView
Foundation/         String+HTMLEntities
```

A few things worth calling out:

**The view model has no UIKit import.** It exposes a `ViewState` enum (`idle / loading / loaded([UserCellModel]) / empty(EmptyReason) / failed(AppError, stale: [UserCellModel])`) through a closure. That's enough to test every state transition without touching a table view. I went with a closure rather than Combine because the surface area doesn't justify the extra concept; it's easy to port later if the app grows.

**`ImageLoader` is an actor** so cache reads/writes and in-flight deduplication don't need explicit locking. When two cells request the same avatar URL concurrently, the second call awaits the first task rather than firing a duplicate request. Decoded bitmaps come back via `UIImage.preparingForDisplay()` so the main thread only sees pre-rendered images. Cancellation happens from the cell's `prepareForReuse` — the `Task` returned from `configure` is held directly on the cell (no Objective-C associated objects).

**`FollowRepository` uses `OSAllocatedUnfairLock`** around the in-memory set of user IDs and writes through to `UserDefaults`. UserDefaults is proportionate here — the payload is a set of ints. A future Core Data migration is a one-file change because everything goes through `FollowRepositoryProtocol`.

**Diffable data source keyed by `user_id`.** Item identity is the user ID only; follow toggles and other row-local changes flow through `snapshot.reconfigureItems(_:)`, which avoids the full-list animation you get when `isFollowed` is part of the item hash.

**UIKit classes are explicitly `@MainActor`.** `UserListViewController`, `UserCell`, and `EmptyStateView` are all pinned to the main actor, and the cell's image-load `Task` is `@MainActor` so UI mutations can't accidentally run on a background thread — this survives Thread Sanitizer cleanly.

## API notes

A few things don't line up with the simplified schema in the brief, and I handled each explicitly:

- The endpoint in the brief is `http://`. I used `https://` to avoid App Transport Security rejections. **No `NSAllowsArbitraryLoads` exception is added.**
- The real response is wrapped in a common envelope (`items`, `has_more`, `quota_max`, `quota_remaining`, plus `error_id / error_name / error_message` on failure). I decode `StackExchangeResponse<User>` first and only then read `items`. An API error body with HTTP 200 is surfaced as `.apiError`, not a decoding failure.
- `badge_counts.bronze` and `silver` are documented as `String` in the brief but the live API returns integers. `BadgeCounts` models them as `Int?`.
- `accept_rate` is marked non-optional in the brief but is absent for bot accounts and users without accepted answers. It (and every field we don't strictly need, including `link`) is `Optional` so a single malformed record can't nuke the other nineteen.
- `display_name` and `location` can come back with HTML entities like `Cura&#231;ao`. They're decoded once at the network boundary via `String.decodingHTMLEntities`.

### Rate limiting

The app calls the Stack Exchange v2.2 API without an API key, which is capped at **300 requests/day per IP**. Running the app a couple of times while reviewing it is fine, but if a shared office IP has already burnt through the quota, you'll see the `.apiError` state with a `throttle_violation` message — that's the API talking, not a bug in the app. Registering a free Stack Apps key would lift the ceiling to 10,000/day, but I deliberately didn't hardcode a personal key in the repo.

### Gravatar & HTTP profile images

Some users' `profile_image` URLs still point to Gravatar over plain `http://`. ATS silently blocks those, and the app falls back to a deterministically-coloured initials placeholder. This is the correct behaviour — loosening ATS for the whole app to fix a few avatars would be a security regression, so I left it.

## Tests

```bash
xcodebuild -project StackOverflowUsers.xcodeproj \
  -scheme StackOverflowUsers \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' test
```

All XCTest cases live in the test target and run offline:

- `DecodingTests` — success wrapper, API error wrapper, empty items, malformed JSON, badge count integers, missing `accept_rate`, HTML entity decoding.
- `UserServiceTests` — stubbed `URLSession` via `URLProtocol` covering HTTPS request shape, 2xx, 5xx, API error body, malformed body, empty items, and transport failure.
- `ImageLoaderTests` — success, HTTP error, transport error, cache hit, and in-flight deduplication.
- `FollowRepositoryTests` — follow/unfollow/toggle, persistence across reinstantiation, and 100-way concurrent writes against an ephemeral `UserDefaults(suiteName:)` suite.
- `UserListViewModelTests` — state transitions for success and every error shape, stale preservation across failures, initial followed state, follow toggling, and All/Followed filter transitions.

No live network calls, no third-party mocking library — `URLProtocol` stubs and plain `XCTestCase` everywhere.

## What I'd add with more time

- **Pagination.** The API supports `page`/`pagesize`. Adding a `loadNextPage()` intent on the view model and wiring `scrollViewDidScroll` to it is a small follow-up.
- **Offline cache.** Persisting the last successful response to disk (JSON via `FileManager`) would let the app show the previous list with a "showing cached data" banner instead of the full-screen empty state when there's no network.
- **Full accessibility audit on device.** VoiceOver labels, custom actions, and Dynamic Type support are in place, but a pass with the Accessibility Inspector at the largest accessibility sizes would surface improvements (particularly announcements for the follow state transition and image-load state). Relevant to European Accessibility Act compliance coming into force in 2025.
- **User detail screen** with badges, location, and the Stack Overflow profile link.
- **Treat warnings as errors.** `SWIFT_TREAT_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS = YES` in release builds would lock in the current zero-warning state.
